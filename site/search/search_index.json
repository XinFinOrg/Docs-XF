The objective of XinFin Network is to become a leading part of this phenomenon through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of applications with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture, allowing for fast, frictionless payment and a secure, decentralised, and trusted store of value. XinFin Network aims to be a public EVM-compatible blockchain with the following advantages: low transaction fee, fast confirmation time, double validation and randomization for security guarantees. XinFin Network envisions an ecosystem of different DApps running on the XinFin Network Blockchain infrastructure. In particular, we propose a solution for solving the transaction processing performance bottleneck in Ethereum which hinders its adoption into industries, especially finance. More specifically, we are constructing an efficient and secured consensus protocol, which tackles the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains: Efficiency: The small throughput of Bitcoin and Ethereum severely hinders a widespread adoption of such crypto- currencies. Confirmation times: Bitcoin takes on average 1 hour to confirm a transaction because the confirmation of a Bitcoin block requires 5 subsequent blocks created following it. While Ethereum uses a smaller block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes. These long confirmation times hinder many important applications (especially smart contract applications). Fork Generation: The problem of fork chain consumes computational energy, time, and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. In the newly published technical paper, XinFin Network proposes the XinFin Delegated Proof-of-Stake (XDPoS) consensus, which is a PoS-based blockchain protocol. The consensus has the following key novelties: Double Validation to strengthen security and reduce fork Randomization to guarantee the fair and prevent handshaking attack Fast confirmation time and efficient checkpoints for finality or rebase","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Community/support/","text":"Welcome, The communities and posts below include content that has been curated by XinFin team members, community members and projects building on XinFin Platform.

XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. XinFin Network relies on a system of 108 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPOS)consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses. What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve? The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows: The network congestion on Ethereum (high transaction time) High transaction fees on Ethereum Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts and supply-chain management. Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second. XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used? XinFin Network relies on a system of 108 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation. Can you tell more about XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS)? What is it? At the heart of XinFin Network, the XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation. XDPoS features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 10,000,000 XDC to become a masternode. masternode are selected for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded. What is Double Validation? Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens XinFin Blockchain security, reduces fork and makes XinFin Network unique among other Delegated Proof of stake based blockchains. What is an 'epoch'? An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes). Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding? XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 18 masternodes with our XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus protocol. We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation. To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our Sharding proposal for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus. Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture. What makes XinFin Network different? The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem. Novel technology: includes XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus Build in governance D-app Double Validation and Randomization Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture This enables XinFin Network to achieve: Cheap transactions: approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem. 2 second block time for fast transactions EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem. Our unique products XinFinScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information XinFinMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; and shows Masternode performance statistics xdcwallet: Securely store, send, receive XinFin and other tokens issued on XinFin Network; Allows users to track rewards Our own ecosystem XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability and tourism. Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors? On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on. On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete. XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture. XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean? EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network. Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum? XinFin Network has its own blockchain which is live since June 1, 2019. Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum? Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners. Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp? Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network. It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum. How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network? In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system. XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization. The details are shown in our technical paper. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block. Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain. XinFin Network addresses by providing finality. Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected. DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XDC in order to flood the network for only a short time.

The list of XinFin Network Products is as follows: XinFinScan, XinFinStats, XinFinMaster, XinFinWebWallet. XinFin - Economics \u00b6 What is XinFin? Can you describe the functions and purposes of XinFin? XDC is the native cryptocurrency of XinFin Network and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on XinFin Network. Being the protocol token for the XinFin Network infrastructure, XDC will be needed by all parties utilising XinFin Network to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps. The supply of XDC is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary. In addition to the above, XDC is an integral part of the XinFin Network network for a number of reasons. XDC will be used to fund the development of XinFin Network and its ecosystem (XinFinScan, XinFinMaster, XinFinWebWallet, etc.). XDC will be used as a incentivise the building of the XinFin Network engine/ecosystem. XDC will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the XinFin Network network. You can check our technical whitepaper for more details. Can I mine XDC? XDC is not mineable but mintable by masternodes. Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch. Masternodes will receive block rewards. How often are block rewards paid out? Block rewards will be paid every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes) When will XDC be listed on new exchanges? We do not discuss about exchange related questions due to the regulation. We will announce every exchange news on our official channels on due time. Is XDC an ERC-20 token? No, XDC is the native coin of the XinFin Network blockchain (XDC01 Protocol). Where to store XDC? How can I send XDC to my wallet? You can store XDC in XinFin Web Wallet, XDC Android wallet and Guarda Wallet. Where can I buy XDC? (exchanges) You can trade XDC on Bitfinex (https://www.bitfinex.com/), Bitrue (https://www.bitrue.com/), Homiex (https://www.homiex.com/), Stex (https://www.stex.com/), Indodax (https://indodax.com/), Hotbit (https://www.hotbit.io/) and Mercatox (https://mercatox.com/). Masternodes \u00b6 Does XinFin Network have Masternodes? How do they work? Yes, XinFin Network has a maximum of 108 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPOS) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation. Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in XinFin platform. Masternode Candidates: Any account can deposit 10,000,000 XDC using XinFinMaster to become a masternode candidate. A Masternode can resign anytime, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation. Rewards: The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs. Masternodes will also receive fees from the XinFin Network which is planned for development. XinFin Network masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards on Mainnet. What is a masternode in the XinFin Network ecosystem? A XinFin Network masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of XDC. What are the incentives to run a masternode? Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternode owners need to invest in XinFin Network by depositing at least 10,000,000 XDC, for the long term. When are Masternode rewards paid out? Masternode operators will receive rewards every epoch. An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). How can I check my rewards? You can check your masternode rewards using XinFin WebWallet. Alternatively you can use XinFinScan. Masternode Candidate \u00b6 What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode? A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 10,000,000 XDC and is listed on XinFinMaster . masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards. How can I become a Masternode? The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate. To become a Masternode Candidate you need: to run XinFin Network software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements to deposit 10,000,000 XDC in a smart-contract via XinFinMaster The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, XinFinMaster . Do I need to use my own computer to run a node? We recommend using an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc). The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime. Which are the hardware requirements to run a node? Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound. Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers. Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) 16 cores CPU 32GB of RAM SSD storage We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%. Those servers would be a good starting point: DigitalOcean: CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU Amazon EC2: C5 instance Google Cloud Engine: n1-highcpu-16 Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance. Note: If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient. How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes? Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of XinFin Network community. Masternode candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode. This list will change dynamically every epoch. Masternodes will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of XDC. Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode? It is recommended for security reasons. You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them. One for your masternode, and one to make the 10,000,000 XDC deposit (this account will receive the rewards). What is the 'coinbase address'? 'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system. We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes. The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees. The private address is from where you make the initial 10,000,000 XDC deposit and where the block rewards will be collected. How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with xdcwallet for Android? Are there other options? You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address. This wallet does not need to contain any XDC, think of it as a shell address. You will then stake XDC into the masternode address via your main XinFin Web wallet. You can use the Android apps. Also you can create wallets with XinFin Web Wallet. You can also use https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address. I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode? It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation. The block rewards are sent to the account connected to XinFinMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address. Can I use the same address pair (XinFin-Node or One-Click-Installer public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node? No. Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses. But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address. I have finished all steps of setting up node. Why I don't see my node on XinFinMaster? You must apply to become a masternode candidate. Do I need to deposit the 10,000,000 XDC before or after running 'One-Click-Installer' in VPS? After. Your node must be fully synched before applying. How do I check the blockchain sync status from the node? You can watch the logs, but it is easier from the XinFinStats website or its eth.blockNumber API call. If the masternode owner deposits 11,000,000 XDC instead of 10,000,000 XDC on its own node, can it later on unstake the excess ? Yes, it can. Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'? A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch. Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct XinFin Network software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner. A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs. At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list. How many nodes I am allowed to run? As many as you can. How can I resign as Masternode? If you no longer want to be a masternode, you can resign on XinFinMaster. Your masternode will stop generating rewards and your funds will be locked for 30 days (1 296 000 blocks). After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 10,000,000 XDC deposit. Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized? No. Your old node will be penalized (10,000,000 XDC initial deposit 30-day lockup) and your new node has to apply again. Is it possible to move a masternode later, like backup and start it from another IP address? Yes. Products \u00b6 XinFinScan \u00b6 What is XinFinScan? XinFinScan is our block explorer. It is pretty similar to EtherScan if you are already familiar with it. XinFinScan provides a user friendly, details and perfection-oriented user interface for XinFin Network block explorer. From a user perspective, XinFinScan brings XinFinChain\u2019s transparency to users, because all block, transaction, finality, smart contracts, dApp and token information are read from XinFin Network and shown to users. Furthermore, XinFinScan also offers technical visualisations and does useful statistics about the XinFin Network performance, token holders and other functionalities. What is a TxHash? How to check a TxHash? TxHash stands for 'transaction hash', and is also known as a transaction ID. An example of what a TxHash looks like: 0x838d33119b33e4519cb201e49bfc570ddc0fbdc6d9cf7038d8254a4de97f7112 To check a TxHash, follow the steps below: On XinFinScan , go to the search bar with the magnifying glass icon. Paste your transaction hash (TxHash) in the search bar and click the icon or press ENTER. Your transaction details will show up. XinFinStats \u00b6 What is XinFinStats? XinFinStats shows the various metrics regarding the current mainnet including the current number of masternodes, masternodes performance, current TPS, block-time, confirmation time, finality and other useful metrics. How much is the average time to see my node appear on XinFinStats? It should be less than a minute after One-Click-Installer command is executed and finished. Stats page wasn't working and showed a 70-second block. What happened? The stats page is javascript code running in your browser. If your computer loses internet connection or the page is not active anymore for some reasons, the time will increase forever. In this case just refresh the page. XinFinMaster \u00b6 What is XinFinMaster? XinFinMaster , the 'Governance dApp', provides a professional UI that allows to see the list of masternodes and candidates, to deposit 10,000,000 XDC to become a masternode candidate, to vote for masternodes, and to show masternode performance statistics. How do I login on XinFinMaster? Go to XinFinMaster. On the top-right corner click 'Login'. Then select how do you want to login: with Private Key. What is the 'capacity' of a Candidate/Masternode? The capacity of a candidate is the 10,000,000 XDC initial deposit for that candidate. What is a 'checkpoint'? For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works. The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. It is worth noting that token holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion. I want to stop running my node. If you don't want to run your masternode anymore, please remember to resign before shutting down the node.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"general/faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"general/faq/#xinfin-network","text":"What is XinFin Network? XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. XinFin Network relies on a system of 108 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPOS)consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses. What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve? The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows: The network congestion on Ethereum (high transaction time) High transaction fees on Ethereum Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts and supply-chain management. Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second. XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used? XinFin Network relies on a system of 108 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation. Can you tell more about XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS)? What is it? At the heart of XinFin Network, the XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation. XDPoS features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 10,000,000 XDC to become a masternode. masternode are selected for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded. What is Double Validation? Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens XinFin Blockchain security, reduces fork and makes XinFin Network unique among other Delegated Proof of stake based blockchains. What is an 'epoch'? An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes). Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding? XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 18 masternodes with our XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus protocol. We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation. To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our Sharding proposal for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus. Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture. What makes XinFin Network different? The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem. Novel technology: includes XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus Build in governance D-app Double Validation and Randomization Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture This enables XinFin Network to achieve: Cheap transactions: approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem. 2 second block time for fast transactions EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem. Our unique products XinFinScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information XinFinMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; and shows Masternode performance statistics xdcwallet: Securely store, send, receive XinFin and other tokens issued on XinFin Network; Allows users to track rewards Our own ecosystem XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability and tourism. Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors? On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on. On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete. XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture. XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean? EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network. Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum? XinFin Network has its own blockchain which is live since June 1, 2019. Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum? Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners. Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp? Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network. It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum. How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network? In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system. XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization. The details are shown in our technical paper. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block. Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain. XinFin Network addresses by providing finality. Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected. DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XDC in order to flood the network for only a short time.","title":"XinFin Network"},{"location":"general/faq/#company","text":"Where is XinFin Network registered?

Can you describe the functions and purposes of XinFin? XDC is the native cryptocurrency of XinFin Network and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on XinFin Network. Being the protocol token for the XinFin Network infrastructure, XDC will be needed by all parties utilising XinFin Network to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps. The supply of XDC is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary. In addition to the above, XDC is an integral part of the XinFin Network network for a number of reasons. XDC will be used to fund the development of XinFin Network and its ecosystem (XinFinScan, XinFinMaster, XinFinWebWallet, etc.). XDC will be used as a incentivise the building of the XinFin Network engine/ecosystem. XDC will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the XinFin Network network. You can check our technical whitepaper for more details. Can I mine XDC? XDC is not mineable but mintable by masternodes. Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch. Masternodes will receive block rewards. How often are block rewards paid out? Block rewards will be paid every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes) When will XDC be listed on new exchanges? We do not discuss about exchange related questions due to the regulation. We will announce every exchange news on our official channels on due time. Is XDC an ERC-20 token? No, XDC is the native coin of the XinFin Network blockchain (XDC01 Protocol). Where to store XDC? How can I send XDC to my wallet? You can store XDC in XinFin Web Wallet, XDC Android wallet and Guarda Wallet. Where can I buy XDC? (exchanges) You can trade XDC on Bitfinex (https://www.bitfinex.com/), Bitrue (https://www.bitrue.com/), Homiex (https://www.homiex.com/), Stex (https://www.stex.com/), Indodax (https://indodax.com/), Hotbit (https://www.hotbit.io/) and Mercatox (https://mercatox.com/).","title":"XinFin - Economics"},{"location":"general/faq/#masternodes","text":"Does XinFin Network have Masternodes? How do they work? Yes, XinFin Network has a maximum of 108 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPOS) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation. Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in XinFin platform. Masternode Candidates: Any account can deposit 10,000,000 XDC using XinFinMaster to become a masternode candidate. A Masternode can resign anytime, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation. Rewards: The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs. Masternodes will also receive fees from the XinFin Network which is planned for development. XinFin Network masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards on Mainnet. What is a masternode in the XinFin Network ecosystem? A XinFin Network masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of XDC. What are the incentives to run a masternode? Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternode owners need to invest in XinFin Network by depositing at least 10,000,000 XDC, for the long term. When are Masternode rewards paid out? Masternode operators will receive rewards every epoch. An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). How can I check my rewards? You can check your masternode rewards using XinFin WebWallet. Alternatively you can use XinFinScan.","title":"Masternodes"},{"location":"general/faq/#masternode-candidate","text":"What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode? A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 10,000,000 XDC and is listed on XinFinMaster . masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards. How can I become a Masternode? The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate. To become a Masternode Candidate you need: to run XinFin Network software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements to deposit 10,000,000 XDC in a smart-contract via XinFinMaster The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, XinFinMaster . Do I need to use my own computer to run a node? We recommend using an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc). The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime. Which are the hardware requirements to run a node? Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound. Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers. Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) 16 cores CPU 32GB of RAM SSD storage We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%. Those servers would be a good starting point: DigitalOcean: CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU Amazon EC2: C5 instance Google Cloud Engine: n1-highcpu-16 Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance. Note: If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient. How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes? Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of XinFin Network community. Masternode candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode. This list will change dynamically every epoch. Masternodes will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of XDC. Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode? It is recommended for security reasons. You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them. One for your masternode, and one to make the 10,000,000 XDC deposit (this account will receive the rewards). What is the 'coinbase address'? 'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system. We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes. The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees. The private address is from where you make the initial 10,000,000 XDC deposit and where the block rewards will be collected. How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with xdcwallet for Android? Are there other options? You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address. This wallet does not need to contain any XDC, think of it as a shell address. You will then stake XDC into the masternode address via your main XinFin Web wallet. You can use the Android apps. Also you can create wallets with XinFin Web Wallet. You can also use https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address. I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode? It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation. The block rewards are sent to the account connected to XinFinMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address. Can I use the same address pair (XinFin-Node or One-Click-Installer public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node? No. Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses. But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address. I have finished all steps of setting up node. Why I don't see my node on XinFinMaster? You must apply to become a masternode candidate. Do I need to deposit the 10,000,000 XDC before or after running 'One-Click-Installer' in VPS? After. Your node must be fully synched before applying. How do I check the blockchain sync status from the node? You can watch the logs, but it is easier from the XinFinStats website or its eth.blockNumber API call. If the masternode owner deposits 11,000,000 XDC instead of 10,000,000 XDC on its own node, can it later on unstake the excess ? Yes, it can. Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'? A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch. Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct XinFin Network software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner. A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs. At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list. How many nodes I am allowed to run?

XinFin's blockchain is a combination of permissioned and public chains that can nicely address security and scalability. XinFin Hybrid Blockchain platform has matured through continuous development and improvements. XinFin's Consensus Mechanism XinFin removed traditional high electrical power consumption based mining mechanism called PoW (Proof of Work). Instead XinFin adopted an improved consensus methodology called PoS (Proof of Stake), and is now slowly moving towards XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS). To understand behind XinFin's decision to go for XDPoS, we need to discuss briefly about the consensus mechanisms. What is Consensus and how PoS, and XDPoS are better than PoW Consensus means a general agreement which is an important component of blockchain technology. Instead of keeping the accounts in a centralized computing machine, as in a bank or centralized online payment system, cryptocurrency uses distributed ledgers or blockchains to record information. A general agreement is needed to record information, such as the balance of every address, transactions, etc. on the blockchain. Proof of Work or PoW relies on solving a cryptographic puzzle repetitively over all the nodes of the network. PoW involves burning very high amount of electrical energy. Proof of Stake doesn't need computers for repetitive solving of the cryptographic puzzle. Insead of miners, PoS requires some validators who will lock some of their crypto coins as stake or deposit. Anybody who holds crypto tokens can become a validator by processing a special type of transaction to lock their crypto fund. A group of validators takes part to propose the next block, and the weight of each validator's depends on the uptime of the node. When the validators discover a block which they think can be added to the blockchain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it. The validators will get a reward proportionate to their bets. How XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake works XinFin Delegated Proof-of-Stake (XDPoS) is more efficient than PoS consensus mechanism. XDPoS uses a reputation system to achieve consensus. The Master node of the network create blocks in a round robin manner. The elected block producers or the witnesses are rewarded for validation of the transactions for the next block. i) Block producers are elected randomly and are limited in numbers who can sign and create blocks. ii) Block validators are the full nodes who verify that the blocks created by the block producers follow the consensus rule. The main difference between XDPoS and PoS is in the consensus mechanism of XDPoS. The community members have more rights in governance of the network. pos and cons of XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake In XDPoS consensus, only the Master Node or the block producers can create the blocks. The transactions are permitted only within the limited number of witnesses. Therefore, XDPoS helps to make processing faster, reduce cost and improve scaling. The witnesses are regularly monitored. If they are found to be malicious, i.e. try to censor transactions or double spend, the other master node can fire a witness by slashing them for the next round. XinFin prefers XDPoS because of speed, cost and scalability Since XDPoS is more democratic, faster, efficient and effective to scale, XinFin naturally preferred to XDPoS.","title":"POW Replaced with XDPOS"},{"location":"get-started/Setupmn/","text":"Setup a Masternode with XinFin MainNet in 8 Simple Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Host the Masternode either by downloading the One-Click Installer (recommended) or by using a Docker Compose file.

Make sure that logic of the code is correct, and the code itself is bug-free. 3.Compile in SimpleWebCompiler: The compiler of XDC is slightly different from that of Ethereum and is still integrating with Remix. Therefore, we are providing a temporary way of acquiring ABI and ByteCode instead of acquiring them directly from Remix. Copy the code above to SImpleWebCompiler and click the Compile button to attain ABI and ByteCode. 4.Deploy Smart Contract via Wallet-cli : Download Wallet-Cli and compile on it.

In an ideal world, a hybrid blockchain will mean controlled access and freedom at the same time. The hybrid blockchain is distinguishable from the fact that they are not open to everyone, but still offers blockchain features such as integrity, transparency, and security. As usual, Hybrid blockchain is entirely customizable. The members of the hybrid blockchain can decide who can take participation in the blockchain or which transactions are made public. This brings the best of both worlds and ensures that a company can work with their stakeholders in the best possible way. Benifits: \u00b6 Works in a closed ecosystem: The number one advantage of hybrid blockchain is its ability to work in a closed ecosystem. That means that companies or organizations don\u2019t have to worry about getting their information leaked when taking advantage of blockchain technology. Changes the rules when needed: Companies thrive on change. The good news about hybrid blockchain is that they need to change rules. However, the nature of the change depends on what the hybrid blockchain is trying to do. However, don\u2019t expect to change data or modify transactions in a hybrid system that handles land registry or user identity for verification purposes. Protecting from 51% attack: Hybrid blockchain are immune to a 51% attack as hackers cannot have access to the network to carry out the attack. Protecting privacy while still communicating with the outer world: Even though private blockchain is best for privacy-related issues. However, they are limited when it comes to communicating with the outer world. Many companies may want to keep privacy, but also need to configure their blockchain so that they can communicate with all their shareholders including the public. Low transaction cost: Another added benefit of using hybrid blockchain is to have a low transaction cost. Transactions are bound to be cheap as it requires few nodes to verify them. The most powerful nodes in the network make it easy to verify the transaction which may take thousands of nodes in public blockchain. The transaction fees can reduce to even 0.01$ per transaction.","title":"Hybrid Blockchain"},{"location":"get-started/hybblock/#benifits","text":"Works in a closed ecosystem: The number one advantage of hybrid blockchain is its ability to work in a closed ecosystem.

These nodes communicate using persistent protocols in order to create and validate transactions. There are three broader categories of functionality one such node may have. These pieces of functionality are provided as services, and one node may run several of them. Notary: Nodes running a notary service witness state spends and have the final say in whether a transaction is a double-spend or not Oracle: Network services that link the ledger to the outside world by providing facts that affect the validity of transactions Regular node: All nodes have a vault and may start protocols communicating with other nodes, notaries and oracles and evolve their private ledger Setting up your own network Certificates Every node in a given Corda network must have an identity certificate signed by the network\u2019s root CA. See Network permissioning for more information. Configuration A node can be configured by adding/editing node.conf in the node\u2019s directory. For details see Node configuration. An example configuration: myLegalName : \"O=Bank A,L=London,C=GB\" keyStorePassword : \"cordacadevpass\" trustStorePassword : \"trustpass\" dataSourceProperties : { dataSourceClassName : org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource \"dataSource.url\" : \"jdbc:h2:file:\"${baseDirectory}\"/persistence\" \"dataSource.user\" : sa \"dataSource.password\" : \"\"} p2pAddress : \"my-corda-node:10002\" rpcSettings = { useSsl = false standAloneBroker = false address : \"my-corda-node:10003\" adminAddress : \"my-corda-node:10004\" } webAddress : \"localhost:10004\" rpcUsers : [ { username=user1, password=letmein, permissions=[ StartFlow.net.corda.protocols.CashProtocol ] } ] devMode : true // certificateSigningService : \"https://testnet.certificate.corda.net\" The most important fields regarding network configuration are: p2pAddress: This specifies a host and port to which Artemis will bind for messaging with other nodes. Note that the address bound will NOT be my-corda-node, but rather :: (all addresses on all network interfaces). The hostname specified is the hostname that must be externally resolvable by other nodes in the network . In the above configuration this is the resolvable name of a machine in a VPN. rpcAddress: The address to which Artemis will bind for RPC calls. webAddress: The address the webserver should bind. Note that the port must be distinct from that of p2pAddress and rpcAddress if they are on the same machine. Bootstrapping the network The nodes see each other using the network map. This is a collection of statically signed node-info files, one for each node in the network. Most production deployments will use a highly available, secure distribution of the network map via HTTP. For test deployments where the nodes (at least initially) reside on the same filesystem, these node-info files can be placed directly in the node\u2019s additional-node-infos directory from where the node will pick them up and store them in its local network map cache. The node generates its own node-info file on startup. In addition to the network map, all the nodes on a network must use the same set of network parameters. These are a set of constants which guarantee interoperability between nodes. The HTTP network map distributes the network parameters which the node downloads automatically. In the absence of this the network parameters must be generated locally. This can be done with the network bootstrapper. This is a tool that scans all the node configurations from a common directory to generate the network parameters file which is copied to the nodes\u2019 directories. It also copies each node\u2019s node-info file to every other node so that they can all transact with each other. The bootstrapper tool can be built with the command: gradlew buildBootstrapperJar The resulting jar can be found in tools/bootstrapper/build/libs/ To use it, create a directory containing a node.conf file for each node you want to create. Then run the following command: java -jar network-bootstrapper.jar <nodes-root-dir For example running the command on a directory containing these files : . +-- notary.conf // The notary's node.conf file +-- partya.conf // Party A's node.conf file +-- partyb.conf // Party B's node.conf file Would generate directories containing three nodes: notary, partya and partyb. This tool only bootstraps a network. It cannot dynamically update if a new node needs to join the network or if an existing one has changed something in their node-info, e.g. their P2P address. For this the new node-info file will need to be placed in the other nodes\u2019 additional-node-infos directory. A simple way to do this is to use rsync. However, if it\u2019s known beforehand the set of nodes that will eventually the node folders can be pregenerated in the bootstrap and only started when needed. Whitelisting Contracts If you want to create a Zone whitelist (see API: Contract Constraints), you can pass in a list of CorDapp jars: `java -jar network-bootstrapper.jar The CorDapp jars will be hashed and scanned for Contract classes. By default the tool would generate a file named whitelist.txt containing an entry for each contract with the hash of the jar. For example: net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Obligation:decd098666b9657314870e192ced0c3519c2c9d395507a238338f8d003929de8 net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash:decd098666b9657314870e192ced0c3519c2c9d395507a238338f8d003929de9 These will be added to the NetworkParameters.whitelistedContractImplementations. See Network Map. This means that by default the Network bootstrapper tool will whitelist all contracts found in all passed CorDapps. In case there is a whitelist.txt file in the root dir already, the tool will append the new jar hashes or contracts to it. The zone operator will maintain this whitelist file, and, using the tool, will append new versions of CorDapps to it. Warning The zone operator must ensure that this file is append only. If the operator removes hashes from the list, all transactions pointing to that version will suddenly fail the constraint verification, and the entire chain is compromised. If a contract is removed from the whitelist, then all states created from that moment on will be constrained by the HashAttachmentConstraint. Note: In future releases, we will provider a tamper-proof way of maintaining the contract whitelist. For fine-grained control of constraints, in case multiple contracts live in the same jar, the tool reads from another file:exclude_whitelist.txt, which contains a list of contracts that should not be whitelisted, and thus default to the very restrictive: HashAttachmentConstraint For example: net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.CommercialPaper Starting the nodes You may now start the nodes in any order. You should see a banner, some log lines and eventually Node started up and registered, indicating that the node is fully started. In terms of process management there is no prescribed method. You may start the jars by hand or perhaps use systemd and friends. Logging Only a handful of important lines are printed to the console. For details/diagnosing problems check the logs. Logging is standard log4j2 and may be configured accordingly. Logs are by default redirected to files in NODE_DIRECTORY/logs/. Connecting to the nodes Once a node has started up successfully you may connect to it as a client to initiate protocols/query state etc. Depending on your network setup you may need to tunnel to do this remotely. See the Using the client RPC API on how to establish an RPC link. Sidenote: A client is always associated with a single node with a single identity, which only sees their part of the ledger.","title":"Build with XinFin Delegated prrof of Stake (XDPoS) Network"},{"location":"get-started/hybnet/#xinfin-private-quorumfork","text":"Prerequisite Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit or higher Tools: Docker, Docker Compose Hardware: CPU : 24 RAM : 08GB HDD : 500GB Network Ports Following network ports need to be open for the nodes to communicate 21001-2100* TCP/UDP GETH 22001-2200* TCP RPC 23001-2300* TCP RAFT 9001-900* TCP Constellation *-auto-increment depending on number of nodes Clone repository git clone https://github.com/XinFinorg/XDC01-docker-Nnodes.git Step: 1 Install docker & docker-compose sudo ./install_docker.sh Step: 2 Pull image from Docker Hub sudo docker pull xinfinorg/quorum:v2.1.0 Step: 3 Launch the setup script cd static-nodes sudo ./setup.sh Enter number of nodes, private IP of host machine & unique docker subnet.

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. One of the best things about the blockchain is since it is a decentralized system that exists between all permitted parties, there is no need to pay intermediaries (Middlemen) and it saves you time and conflicts. Blockchains have their problems, but they are rated, undeniably, faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional systems, which is why banks and governments are turning to them. Imagine if there were some self-executing contracts, in which contracts would be converted to computer code, stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain. All of this is what makes up smart contracts. What are Smart Contracts?: \u00b6 A smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other. If and when the predefined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The smart contract code facilitates, verifies, and enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement or transaction. It is the simplest form of decentralized automation. In simpler words, it is rather a form of exchange of any type like money, property etc in a conflict-free way without the services of a middleman so it is trustless execution which is an important feature that smart contracts promises. Bitcoin was the first to support basic smart contracts in the sense that the network can transfer value from one person to another. The network of nodes will only validate transactions if certain conditions are met. Here is an example of a simple smart contract where we use simple set and get function then we increment and decrement some data. Features of Smart Contract \u00b6 Various features provided by smart contracts are: 1.Trust \u2014 Your documents are encrypted on a shared ledger. There\u2019s no way that someone can say they lost it. Smart contracts allow parties to commit and bind by the conditions and rules written inside it. 2.Transparency: Everything is written inside a smart contract with intricate details so anyone can read the details before agreeing and thus eliminates the chance of future disputes. There is no miscommunication as all the information is open with everybody. 3. Autonomous: You\u2019re the one making the agreement; there\u2019s no need to rely on a broker, lawyer or other intermediaries to confirm. This also knocks out the danger of manipulation by a third party, since execution is managed automatically by the network. 4.Accuracy: Automated contracts are not only faster and cheaper but also avoid the errors that come from a person making the contract who can miss some conditions but in smart contracts, it will result in an error, therefore, all the conditions are put in a detailed form. 5.Speed: If anyone would read documents or contracts manually it would take a chunk of time, whereas smart contracts are a bunch of code used to automate task and hence save hours of time. 6.Savings: Smart contracts can help to save a lot of money as it removes the presence of an intermediary. For instance, you would pay a lawyer for your case but in smart contracts, it\u2019s all in your hand as the code is the law. 7.Safety: Cryptographically encryption keeps your data safe. Since they match the highest safety standards, the level of protection involved in them allows to be secure to use for critical processes Problem Solution \u00b6 1.We can solve some of the problems with smart contracts like upgrade problems by using modular smart contracts. So, we can have modular.sol files while building on Ethereum that can be easily upgraded without losing information. 2.Using Delegatecall-based proxies for contract upgrading. In delegatecall logic data are kept in separate contracts, but the data contract (the proxy) calls the logic contract through delegatecall. It is difficult to apply the delegatecall-based proxy pattern correctly. The proxy pattern requires that memory layouts stay consistent between contract and compiler upgrades. A developer unfamiliar with EVM internals can easily introduce critical bugs during an upgrade. 3.The legal issues of smart contracts can only be solved over time as they are in their initial development stage; it will require time. 4.The major problem of writing smart contracts can be solved by not implementing Turing-complete smart contracts. 5.And, the oracle problem can be solved maybe by a consensus protocol in the community itself which will help to see how things are in the physical world. Application of Smart Contracts \u00b6 1.Digital Identity: Smart contracts allow users to own and control their digital identity i.ie data, reputation and assets. It provides enterprises with the opportunity to seamlessly know their customers while individuals may not disclose sensitive data which reduces the frictionless know-your-customer requirements. 2.Financial Data Recording: Financial organizations can utilize smart contracts for accurate, transparent financial data recording. Smart contracts allow for uniform financial data across organizations, improving financial reporting and reducing auditing costs.By improving data integrity, smart contracts support increased market stability. They also reduce accounting costs by allowing cost sharing among organizations. 3.Healthcare: Personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key which would grant access only to specific individuals. The same strategy could be used to ensure that research is conducted via HIPAA laws (in a secure and confidential way). Receipts of surgeries could be stored on a blockchain and automatically sent to insurance providers as proof-of-delivery. The ledger, too, could be used for general healthcare management, such as supervising drugs, regulation compliance, testing results, and managing healthcare supplies. 4.Real Estate: You can get more money through smart contracts. Ordinarily, if you wanted to rent your apartment to someone, you\u2019d need to pay a middleman such as Craigslist or a newspaper to advertise and then again you\u2019d need to pay someone to confirm that the person paid rent and followed through. The ledger cuts your costs. All you do is pay via bitcoin and encode your contract on the ledger. Conclusion \u00b6 Smart contracts do offer a lot and have shown signs of how promising they can be, but they are still in their initial stages so with time maybe we will see their actual potential which could provide for all sorts of social changes which is really exciting. A big problem lies with the organizations as well, as they are adopting blockchains due to the buzzword but not considering how to use it to its fullest. If organizations manage that beforehand then maybe writing smart contracts can get easier. But the actual problem still lies in writing smart contracts and gaining the trust of people again after the DAO hack. In the coming future, we may witness a hybrid of paper and digital content where contracts are verified via blockchain and substantiated by physical copy.","title":"Smart Contract"},{"location":"get-started/smartcont/#what-are-smart-contracts","text":"A smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other.

A Complete Guide on StableCoin. We shall discuss the following topics in the article: What is a StableCoin Types of StableCoins Why StableCoin Real-World Applications of Stable Coins Top StableCoins in the Market How to Build a Stablecoin To Compete with Libra or USD Coin. What is a StableCoin? Explaining Stablecoin XinFin XDC Network's Stable coins aim to bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies\u2019 benefits and the stable nature offered by fiat currencies. It is a crypto token with a value pegged to the price of a national currency to combat its volatility. Now, the question is, why do we need a stable coin. Though cryptocurrencies are global currencies, coins like Bitcoin and Ether are volatile. The price of Bitcoin raised from USD 1000 to USD 20000 during 2017. Since it is not sustainable, users and investors require more stability in the market. Imagine that you pay USD 30 for dinner today and the same amount would be worth USD 40 tomorrow because the value of that crypto token went up. Small investors cannot handle that kind of volatility. Therefore, stable coins emerged as a new technique to drive the new way of adoption to cryptocurrencies. You might think why do we need to create fiat-backed crypto tokens instead of just using fiat currency. Decentralized currencies do not require any centralized authority to bring trust in the system, thereby reducing additional costs involved. Also, cross border payments can be made quickly with cryptocurrencies. Backing crypto tokens with stable fiat currency or assets can add more value and build more trust among investors and users. What are the types of StableCoins? Fiat-backed Fiat backed stablecoins are crypto tokens associated with the value of a specific fiat currency. These tokens hold their value fixed at 1:1 ratio. For example, Tether is a stable coin, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Fiat currency is deposited as collateral to ensure the existence of a fiat-backed stablecoin. As a result, it requires financial custodian and regular auditing to determine that the token always remains collateralized. e.g: Facebook LIBRA, USD Coin (USDC), Gemini stablecoin (GUSDT) etc Non-collateralized Non-collateralized stablecoins are based on the concept of a Seigniorage Shares system. Seigniorage is the difference between the value of money and its printing cost. These coins depend on the algorithm, which changes the supply volume to control their price. Using smart contracts, these stable coins are sold if the price falls below the pegged currency and more tokens are supplied to the market if its value rises above the pegged currency. Cryptocurrency-backed Cryptocurrency-backed stable coins work similarly to that of a fiat-backed stablecoin. However, it locks up cryptocurrency as collateral instead of using fiat currency. For example, Ethereum can be kept as collateral to create a cryptocurrency-backed stablecoin. These tokens use a security pledge to compensate for the volatility of cryptocurrency to be used as collateral. It states that the stablecoin will not be based on 1:1 ration for the crypto collateral. Commodity-collateralized Commodity-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other types of interchangeable assets like real estate and precious metals. Gold is one of the most common commodities to be collateralized. Commodity-backed stable coins hold a tangible asset with some real value. These commodities can appreciate value over time, which offers an increased incentive to people to use and keep these coins. Using commodity-collateralized stable coins, anyone can invest in real estate properties or precious metals across the world. Generally, the investment in such assets is only reserved for the wealthy class of investors. However, stablecoins open up investment opportunities for average individuals globally. Why StableCoin? A XinFin stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that offers low volatility against the world\u2019s major national currencies, unlocking the benefits for decentralized technology. In a nutshell, stablecoins can be defined as a cryptocurrency with a fixed price. A reliable stablecoin offers a number of use cases than that of the blockchain. People no more need to worry about the fluctuations in prices of the cryptocurrency daily while buying them. Stability in cryptocurrencies allows people to transact quickly and it also enables other crucial financial functions, including credit and loans. Moreover, a stable decentralized currency could become a global currency by allowing trustless and cross-border transactions. It will especially benefit people residing in countries with unstable monetary systems like Argentina. Therefore, stablecoins emerge as a new option for investors who want to make a transaction via a global currency, providing access to all.

The core of the innovation is built around the concept of a distributed cryptographic database. The database, also referred to as the ledger, is maintained by a network of computers. The ledger makes it possible for the entire network to create, evolve and keep track of an immutable record of transactions. The most successful blockchain application thus far has been Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 s cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, which he outlined in his seminal paper, \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d in 2008. This powerful technology has so far been implicated in the numerous cryptocurrencies that exist online. Financial institutions are only beginning to understand the potential applications of blockchain in conventionally regulated industries. Understanding the Blockchain : At a fundamental level the blockchain is a data structure that cryptographically links blocks of transactions or any potential transfers of value. As a paradigm, the blockchain allows for true privacy to exist between those involved in a transaction. This characteristic of the blockchain that makes its most significant implementation in the financial industry. Its structure allows for automation, immutability, and decentralization. These characteristics were carefully chosen by Nakamoto in order to create a digital mechanism of trust. For the financial world this would result in a more limited reliance on third party trust mechanisms enabling a direct contractual interface between two parties involved in any transfer of value. This technology has the power make such exchanges safer, faster, and costeffective. Ownership of value stored in the blockchain is established through asymmetrical cryptography. Digital keys, wallet addresses, and digital signatures are all created cryptographically to ensure total privacy in transmission of transactional data. Every transaction on the blockchain needs to be 'signed' using digital keys. Whoever owns these keys, owns access to the value stored in the wallet. All keys generated by the wallet software come in pairs; a private key, which is kept secret and a public key. The public key is akin to a bank account number and the private key is like the secret pin used to control the account. The idea behind digital signatures is that private and public key pair shares a mathematical relationship such that a message (transaction) signed by a private key can be verified by a public key without revealing the private key. Public Blockchain : The Bitcoin's blockchain network is structured as a peer-to-peer network architecture. In this network implementation, all nodes are equal or symmetric. There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy in the Bitcoin's network. Blockchain implementations for the financial industry however, cannot allow for such an open and symmetric network structure. Bitcoin enthusiasts advocate, therefore, that the blockchain and Bitcoin are fundamentally linked. This is a short sighted view taking into consideration that the Bitcoin technology stack exists to solve the problem of an unregulated digital currency. The same stack can be evolved to solve similar transfers of value over an asymmetric network. The XDC Protocol: Technical Whitepaper by Xinfin Organization. September 2017. All rights reserved. V1.0 4 The development of the Ethereum blockchain was a major milestone in the blockchain ecosystem. The focus shifted onto system state and virtual machines that could run smart contracts across the network. With the availability of Turing complete smart contracts, the limited functionality of the Bitcoin scripting language was overcome and a number of different applications became possible. Private Blockchain : Private blockchains came into prominence with the Hyperledger Project that saw participation from IBM and Intel in 2016. Another major private blockchain developed by R3 called Corda also raised significant amounts of money. Since then, R3 has also joined the Hyperledger Project. Fully private blockchains make the case that centralized and trusted implementation of the core data structure of the blockchain along with significant changes to the consensus mechanism are meaningful value propositions for enterprise applications. Hybrid Blockchain : Hybrid blockchains are fairly unexplored and only few implementations exist; even in development.

Understanding Xinpay \u00b6 XinPay is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run XinFin DApps right in your browser without running a full XinFin node. While doing transactions on the blockchain network, it uses computing power which is called gas cost, and much like gas in real life, you have to pay for it. For you to pay that gas cost, you will need a wallet that handles your money, and that\u2019s where XinPay comes in. Well, I guess that\u2019s enough information about XinPay for now. We don\u2019t have to explore every angle of the equation. I bet you get the gist of its purpose already. Without further ado, let\u2019s jump right into the first question! How can I install it? \u00b6 Before you install XinPay, you have to know that XinPay only supports a couple of browsers. XinPay supports the following browsers: - Google Chrome (or any Chromium browsers, Brave, a DApp Chromium browser.) - Mozilla Firefox - Opera If you already have any of the above, you can proceed, otherwise, you should download at least one of the listed browsers and you\u2019re good to go! For you to download XinPay, you should first go to this link and download it. You can also download XinPay on your browser\u2019s plugin extension web store, but if you want to be directed automatically to the download page dedicated for your browser, the link is the way to go. Once you\u2019re inside, you should see Xinpay iconic XinFin head following your mouse direction. Under it, you should see the GET CHROME EXTENSION orange button, click that, and you\u2019ll be automatically directed to your browser\u2019s store. For Google Chrome browser\u2019s example, you should see something like this Now after getting in, just add the plugin extension, and it will install itself on the browser after downloading. (in Chrome\u2019s case, click the Add to Chrome button.) Once it is installed, a new tab will suddenly pop up, it\u2019s the Xinpay wallet\u2019s welcome page. But you\u2019ll get the same interface on the actual wallet so just close it. Once closed, click here: If you click that icon, you should trigger the Metamask wallet\u2019s user interface. This is how the wallet looks like: Now just click continue, and you\u2019ll be directed to creating your password. Don\u2019t go import seed since you don\u2019t have an existing account yet. You will use that if you want to recover your account. We'll talk about account recovery later in this article. After creating and confirming your password, you\u2019ll go through some terms and agreements, then you\u2019ll be given a secret backup phrase. That phrase is the heart of your account since it is derived from a unique hash created when you created the account just now. As said, you shouldn\u2019t compromise the phrase to anyone, because if your wallet has XDC inside then that can be transferred to someone else. Although Xinpay is a wallet made for developers, you still have to exercise secrecy. (The account I have shown is for demonstration purposes so it\u2019s totally fine.) After saving the phase, you will need to confirm it next. Then it will ask you if you want to deposit, skip, and close that for now. Finally, you\u2019re done! You have successfully installed Xinpay, and made your very own wallet. Yeah, we did install Xinpay, but what is the catch about that wallet? What is it capable of? This leads us to the next point: What can it do? \u00b6 For the features of Xinpay, there\u2019s a lot that you can do. But I\u2019m not going to cover everything since my focus is to teach you just enough to get you ready for developing your XinFin decentralized applications. Here are the basic features of Xinpay that you will need: Adding/Importing accounts Switching accounts Switching networks Requesting tokens (Testnet Faucet) Sending tokens (XDC) Adding/Searching for token Getting backup seed Alright! That\u2019s all you need to know about the features. Let\u2019s now head to the next question: How do I use it? \u00b6 To track our progress easily, let\u2019s just learn all those listed features from top to bottom. But before that, I\u2019m just going to show you a few helpful things: Let\u2019s try to look at the highlighted portion on the top side. Below the name of the account: Account 1, you can see random-looking character string, something that looks like this - xdc607b... That is your account\u2019s wallet address, if you click it, the address will be copied onto your clipboard. This is very helpful since you\u2019ll be using your account a lot on your smart contract development and your dApps as a test account. Next is the one below it, which is your transaction history. Here you will see the state of your transactions whether or not it is finished, pending or the transaction had failed, etc. Also, if you want to switch the value from Fiat to dx you can do that by going to the top right highlighted button, as shown here: When clicked, a window will show up under it. From there, you can see from the bottom-most part, which is the Settings button with the gear icon. Hit that button and it should show this: You\u2019ll be taken to this interface, initially on the Settings tab. Without scrolling, you\u2019ll be able to see the Primary Currency section, from the Fiat radio button, switch it to *XDC, and that\u2019s it. If you go back to your Main interface by hitting the head button, it should change by now: Adding/Importing accounts \u00b6 For this feature, it lets you add more than one wallet. This can be useful both in development and in real life. Since you\u2019ll be making applications, you will need to test not only one account but will have to get your accounts to interact with each other on a smart contract. Makes sense, right? Adding accounts \u00b6 From main, for you to add an account, just go to the highlighted top right button and click it. This will prompt a new window, showing a list of items. On the top side of that window, it shows the list of accounts that you currently have. As of now, you only have one account which is Account 1. To add another, just click the first option below it: + Create Account. When clicked, you\u2019ll be directed to a very self-explanatory interface, which contains an input for the name of your account and the button Create, hit it. When you go back, you'll have your new account waiting for you. It also has its unique address. Importing accounts \u00b6 If you have an existing account, you can click on Import Account. You will be taken in an interface where you will have to put a secret backup phase in the private key string text input of the Private Key category. If you want to import JSON, you can do so by changing it in JSON. The last thing to do is to hit the Import button. Switching accounts \u00b6 Since you learned how to import and add accounts, I assume you made new ones too. So, let\u2019s learn how to switch accounts! In the example above, you can see that I have already added 2 more accounts: Account 2 and Account 3. On the same window as before, if we want to switch to Account 2, from the list, just click it. Switching networks \u00b6 Switching networks is an important thing about Xinpay. As you have recently seen, we\u2019re using the Main XinFin Network. But that\u2019s not the development network, there\u2019s a network for one. As you can see in the picture above, we\u2019re on the Main network. But underneath it is developers\u2019 available networks. Most often, developers usually use the XinFin Apothem Network. That is if you\u2019re using Remix directly with injected Web3 setting. Localhost:8545 however, is for your local XinFin network. Choosing a network is a case to case basis, but for common action, let\u2019s choose Apothem Test Network, click it and you\u2019re in it already! Request tokens \u00b6 Making transactions costs gas amount, and gas costs money. So we will need tokens every time we interact with/test contracts or send tokens. But all these are mostly used if you\u2019re going to spend and do real transactions on Main-net. For the developers, however, if you switch to a developer network such as Apothem Network, you will see this: You will see a Test Faucet. By clicking the XinFin Apothem Testnet Test Faucet button, you will be able to get free tokens. But these tokens have no real value since it\u2019s a testing network. By just clicking the blue button, you\u2019ll be able to request XDC. From there, for a short moment, it will take effect and give you tokens that you\u2019ll be needing as gas for testing in development. Here is the link of the Testnet Faucet, get yours now! Send tokens \u00b6 Before proceeding, try getting tokens for at your one account from the Test Faucet on Apothem Network. If you already have tokens, we can now try to send tokens to another account. To see the effect, send it to your other created account. From the Apothem Network, if you hit the Send button, you\u2019ll be sent to this interface. In the example, Account 1 has 100 XDC, and by hitting the recipient address input text, you\u2019ll be able to choose or pastedown an address. In your case, use your account that has XDC, and send it to your other account. Set the amount on the Amount section, and you can set how fast the transaction will be beneath it, it\u2019s customizable. After you set everything, hit Next. And you\u2019ll be sent in this interface: Confirmation Interface \u00b6 This is the exact interface whenever you make transactions on XinFin using Xinpay. You\u2019ll see a lot of this prompting interface once you start developing. From here you can also edit the gas fee, to make your transaction faster. In here, we are sending 0.457 XDC to Account 1. Hit Confirm and your transaction will be processed and will also show up on your Transaction History on the main interface. Add/Search tokens \u00b6 Aside from XDC token, there are also different kinds of tokens that you can use based on the kind of DApp you use. Usually, when you make a DApp they also make their cryptocurrency. So here, I\u2019ll show you how to search and add your token. Add tokens \u00b6 From the main interface, go to top left menu icon beneath the Home button. Once you hit the menu, you\u2019ll be able to see this one slide: From what you can see above, your token shows up, under that is a supposed list for the other tokens. Since you only have the XinFin token, you can\u2019t notice the list. With that said, you can add a token, it\u2019s either you add your own made token from an ERC20 standard contract or you search someone\u2019s token assuming that you have one already. Let\u2019s go with adding your own first. On the Custom Token tab is where you can add your own created token. There are 3 input fields. The last two fill in by themselves once you fill in the Token Address input text field. So the first one is the only one needed. If you plan to make your token, you can try it on the Custom Token tab. Just hit Next and you\u2019re good to go. It is added to the list. If you choose one from the list, you can use it for your transactions related to that token. Now on to the searching of the token. Search tokens \u00b6 Same as before, if you go to the menu icon again, on the Search tab, you will see this interface: As seen above, XF is a known example of a crypto token. If in an instance, you have received XF tokens, then you can search and verify it from here, and add it to your token list. Get backup seed \u00b6 If in case you forgot your secret backup phrase, you can get it from your settings, so go back to settings from the top-right menu button. When you get inside Settings, and if you scroll down in the middle you will find the Reveal Seed Words section. If you hit the Reveal Seed Words button, the secret backup phrase will be shown and you can copy it. Keep it safe! Questions?

That tutorial sure was a bit long but I\u2019m pretty sure that what you learned just now, will equip you enough for your future or current developments for making your decentralized XinFin applications. In case you forget some things you learned from here, you can always come back. It\u2019s natural if you don\u2019t remember everything in one go, every developer\u2019s been there. You\u2019ll get better soon enough! Even these non-blockchain related Microsoft developers are happy for you: Hope you learned a lot and good luck venturing deeper into blockchain. Until then, signing out, and stay tuned!","title":"Features"},{"location":"xinfinpay/features/#get-started-with-xinpay-crypto-asset","text":"In this tutorial, we\u2019ll be discussing an essential technology that correlates with the core operation of XinFin \u2014 Network transactions.","title":"Get Started with XinPay Crypto Asset"},{"location":"xinfinpay/features/#understanding-xinpay","text":"XinPay is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run XinFin DApps right in your browser without running a full XinFin node. While doing transactions on the blockchain network, it uses computing power which is called gas cost, and much like gas in real life, you have to pay for it. For you to pay that gas cost, you will need a wallet that handles your money, and that\u2019s where XinPay comes in. Well, I guess that\u2019s enough information about XinPay for now. We don\u2019t have to explore every angle of the equation. I bet you get the gist of its purpose already. Without further ado, let\u2019s jump right into the first question!","title":"Understanding Xinpay"},{"location":"xinfinpay/features/#how-can-i-install-it","text":"Before you install XinPay, you have to know that XinPay only supports a couple of browsers. XinPay supports the following browsers: - Google Chrome (or any Chromium browsers, Brave, a DApp Chromium browser.) - Mozilla Firefox - Opera If you already have any of the above, you can proceed, otherwise, you should download at least one of the listed browsers and you\u2019re good to go! For you to download XinPay, you should first go to this link and download it. You can also download XinPay on your browser\u2019s plugin extension web store, but if you want to be directed automatically to the download page dedicated for your browser, the link is the way to go. Once you\u2019re inside, you should see Xinpay iconic XinFin head following your mouse direction. Under it, you should see the GET CHROME EXTENSION orange button, click that, and you\u2019ll be automatically directed to your browser\u2019s store. For Google Chrome browser\u2019s example, you should see something like this Now after getting in, just add the plugin extension, and it will install itself on the browser after downloading. (in Chrome\u2019s case, click the Add to Chrome button.) Once it is installed, a new tab will suddenly pop up, it\u2019s the Xinpay wallet\u2019s welcome page. But you\u2019ll get the same interface on the actual wallet so just close it. Once closed, click here: If you click that icon, you should trigger the Metamask wallet\u2019s user interface. This is how the wallet looks like: Now just click continue, and you\u2019ll be directed to creating your password. Don\u2019t go import seed since you don\u2019t have an existing account yet. You will use that if you want to recover your account. We'll talk about account recovery later in this article. After creating and confirming your password, you\u2019ll go through some terms and agreements, then you\u2019ll be given a secret backup phrase. That phrase is the heart of your account since it is derived from a unique hash created when you created the account just now. As said, you shouldn\u2019t compromise the phrase to anyone, because if your wallet has XDC inside then that can be transferred to someone else. Although Xinpay is a wallet made for developers, you still have to exercise secrecy. (The account I have shown is for demonstration purposes so it\u2019s totally fine.) After saving the phase, you will need to confirm it next. Then it will ask you if you want to deposit, skip, and close that for now. Finally, you\u2019re done! You have successfully installed Xinpay, and made your very own wallet. Yeah, we did install Xinpay, but what is the catch about that wallet? What is it capable of? This leads us to the next point:","title":"How can I install it?"},{"location":"xinfinpay/features/#what-can-it-do","text":"For the features of Xinpay, there\u2019s a lot that you can do. But I\u2019m not going to cover everything since my focus is to teach you just enough to get you ready for developing your XinFin decentralized applications. Here are the basic features of Xinpay that you will need: Adding/Importing accounts Switching accounts Switching networks Requesting tokens (Testnet Faucet) Sending tokens (XDC) Adding/Searching for token Getting backup seed Alright! That\u2019s all you need to know about the features. Let\u2019s now head to the next question:","title":"What can it do?"},{"location":"xinfinpay/features/#how-do-i-use-it","text":"To track our progress easily, let\u2019s just learn all those listed features from top to bottom. But before that, I\u2019m just going to show you a few helpful things: Let\u2019s try to look at the highlighted portion on the top side. Below the name of the account: Account 1, you can see random-looking character string, something that looks like this - xdc607b... That is your account\u2019s wallet address, if you click it, the address will be copied onto your clipboard. This is very helpful since you\u2019ll be using your account a lot on your smart contract development and your dApps as a test account. Next is the one below it, which is your transaction history. Here you will see the state of your transactions whether or not it is finished, pending or the transaction had failed, etc. Also, if you want to switch the value from Fiat to dx you can do that by going to the top right highlighted button, as shown here: When clicked, a window will show up under it. From there, you can see from the bottom-most part, which is the Settings button with the gear icon. Hit that button and it should show this: You\u2019ll be taken to this interface, initially on the Settings tab. Without scrolling, you\u2019ll be able to see the Primary Currency section, from the Fiat radio button, switch it to *XDC, and that\u2019s it.

To add another, just click the first option below it: + Create Account. When clicked, you\u2019ll be directed to a very self-explanatory interface, which contains an input for the name of your account and the button Create, hit it.

What is XinFin Remix ? \u00b6 XinFin Remix is a web browser-based IDE (Integrated development environment) that allows user to write Solidity smart contracts, then Compile, Deploy & run the smart contract on XinFin Blockchain Network New and upgrade Structure for the XinFin Remix \u00b6 Icon Panel - click to change which plugin appears in the Side Panel Side Panel - Most but not all plugins will have their GUI here. Main Panel - In the old layout, this was just for editing files. In the tabs can be plugins or files for the IDE to compile. Terminal - where you will see the results of your interactions with the GUI\u2019s. Also, you can run scripts here. Icon Panel at Page Load \u00b6 When you load Remix, the \u2018Icon\u2019 panel shows these icons by default. In the upgraded version, everything in Remix is a plugin, making the Plugin Manager highly crucial. On the contrary, each basic task was separated into the tabs in the old layout of Remix. These tabs are now redesigned as plugins. The number of plugins you\u2019re using at a single time might affect the page loading and make it slightly tedious due to the power required to activate the plugins. Homepage \u00b6 The homepage is located on the top left corner of the tab in the Main Panel. Clicking on the Remix logo at the top of the Icon panel also opens the Homepage. Environments \u00b6 You can click on one of the environment buttons to load a collection of plugins. In our new version, we have a Solidity Button and a Vyper button, but you will be able to save your own environment in the near future. To see all the plugins, go to the plugin manager by selecting the Plugin icon in the Icon panel. The Environment buttons are time & sanity savers so you don\u2019t need to access the plugin manager to get started every time you load the page. Plugin Manager \u00b6 We wanted to make Remix flexible for integrating changes into its functionality and for integrating Remix into other projects such as yours. So we transformed everything into a plugin. With this, you only require to load the functionality you need. To let you easily manage and turn your plugins on and off as per your need, we have the Plugin Manager. You can also create your own plugin and load your local plugin into Remix using the Plugin Manager. You can do so by clicking the \u201cConnect to a Local Plugin\u201d link at the top of the Plugin Manager panel. Themes \u00b6 To make working on Remix fun and more friendly, we added the themes section. You can now work with a dark theme or a grey theme or just any custom theme that best fits your needs. To choose a theme, go to the settings tab and you can find several bootstrap-based themes towards the bottom of the page. File Explorer \u00b6 To go to the file explorer, click the \u2018File Explorer\u2019 icon. The file explorer by default lists all the files stored in your browser. You can see them in the browser folder and rename, remove or add new files to the file explorer. Note: Clearing the browser storage will permanently delete all the solidity files you wrote. To avoid this, you can use Remix, which enables you to store and sync files in the browser with your local computer. Create a New File \u00b6 You can use the \u2018create new file\u2019 option to create a new untitled.sol file in Remix. Add Local File \u00b6 If you want to import a local file to the Remix browser storage, you can do so with the \u2018add local file\u2019 option. Publish to Gist \u00b6 You can publish all files from the browser folder to a gist using this feature. It must be noted that Gist API has changed in 2018 and it now requires users to be authenticated before they can publish a gist. Click this link to Github tokens setup and select Generate new token. Check only the \u2018Create Gists\u2019 checkbox and generate a new token. Then paste it in Remix (right panel/Settings tab) and click Save. Now you will be able to use the feature. Copy to another Remix instance \u00b6 This feature enables you to copy files from the browser storage to another instance (URL) of Remix. Connect your filesystem to Remix \u00b6 You can use this to sync between Remix and your local file system. Plugin Manager \u00b6 Everything is a PLUGIN in Remix \u00b6 To make it easier to integrate new tools made by us and by you into Remix, we\u2019ve now made everything a plugin. This architecture allows Remix or any part of Remix to be integrated into other projects in a simpler way. With the advent of Plugins, you will only have to load the functionality you need. It also gives you the benefit of turning off and on plugins as per your need. You can manage all your plugins in the Pugin Manager, which is also the section of Remix where you can create your own plugin or load your local plugin into Remix. To do the latter, you can click on the \u201cConnect to a Local Plugin\u201d link at the top of the Plugin Manager panel. To learn more about how to create your own plugin, go to the README of Remix-plugin repo. Settings \u00b6 You can access Settings by clicking the gear icon at the bottom of the icon panel. You can find a link to the homepage (if you closed it) as well as a link to our Gitter Channel. We also have a rather large list of themes for all you aesthetes out there. Another important setting: \u00b6 Text wrap: Use this to control how the text in the editor should be wrapped. Enable optimization: This defines if the compiler should enable optimization during compilation. You can enable this option to save execution gas. It is useful to enable optimization for contracts ready to be deployed in production but could lead to some inconsistencies when debugging such a contract. Solidity Editor \u00b6 The Remix editor recompiles the code whenever the current file is changed or another file is selected. It also provides syntax highlighting mapped to solidity keywords. Here\u2019s the list of some important features: \u00b6 It displays opened files as tabs. Compilation Warning and Error are displayed in the gutter. Remix automatically saves the current file every five seconds. +/- on the top left corner can be used to alter the font size of the editor. Terminal \u00b6 Primary features available in the terminal: \u00b6 It integrates a JavaScript interpreter and the web3 object. It enables the execution of the JavaScript script which interacts with the current context. (note that web3 is only available if the web provider or injected provider mode is selected). It displays important actions made while interacting with the Remix IDE (i.e. sending a new transaction). It displays transactions that are mined in the current context. You can choose to display all transactions or only transactions that refer to the contracts Remix knows (e.g transaction created from the Remix IDE). It allows searching for the data and clearing the logs from the terminal. It allows you to run scripts by inputting them at the bottom after the >. Compiler (Solidity) \u00b6 Clicking the Solidity icon in the Icon panel will take you to the Solidity Compiler. By default, you need to click the compile button to trigger compilation(D. in the image below). You can check the auto compile checkbox in case you want the file to be compiled each time the file is saved or when another file is selected (E. in the image below). Since the release of Solidity version 0.5.7, it is possible to compile Yul files. Please read the solidity documentation about Yul which contains some code examples. You can use the language dropdown (B. in the image below) to switch the language. This dropdown list is only available for versions 0.5.7 and beyond. The fork selection dropdown list (C. in the image below) allows you to compile code against a specific ethereum hard fork. The compiler default corresponds to the default hard fork used by a specific version. Please go to \u201cCompilation Details\u201d (G. in the image below) in the settings of the Metadata section to see the harfork name used for the current compilation. If the contract has a lot of dependencies, it can take a while to compile. So you can use auto compilation at your discretion for instantaneous compilation. After each compilation, a list is updated with all newly compiled contracts. A compiled contract can then be selected with the Contract pulldown menu (F. in the image below). Multiple contracts are compiled when one contract imports other contracts. You can select any of these contracts to check the information regarding that. On clicking the \u201cCompilation Details\u201d button (G. in the image below), a modal opens displaying detailed information about the currently selected contract. You can also publish your non-abstract contract to Swarm from the same tab. Published data notably contains the ABI and the solidity source code. After a contract is published, you can find its metadata information using the bzz URL located in the details modal dialogue SWARM LOCATION. After each compilation, the static analysis tab builds a report, which is very valuable when addressing reported issues even if the compiler doesn\u2019t complain. Any compilation error or warning is displayed below the contract section. See more. Deploy & Run \u00b6 You can send transactions to the current environment using the Deploy & Run module. To go to Deploy & Run module, click the \u2018Run\u2019 icon in the Icon panel. In order to use this module, you need to have a contract compiled. So, if there is a contract name in the contract select box (in the image below it\u2019s the pulldown that says Ballot), you can interact with this contract otherwise you need to select a new contract. To do that, you need to click the file in the editor panel to make it the active tab (in the image below, on the right side of the page in the main panel, the ballot.sol is the active contract). Once it\u2019s active, go to the compiler module and compile it. You can then use the Deploy & Run module. Run Setup \u00b6 The following settings allow you to directly influence the transaction execution: Environment: \u00b6 JavaScript VM: All the transactions will be executed in a sandbox blockchain in the browser. This means nothing will persist after you reload the page. The JsVM is its own blockchain and on every reload it initiates a new blockchain without saving the old one. Injected Provider: Remix will connect to an injected web3 provider. Metamask is an example of a provider that injects web3. Web3 Provider: Remix will connect to a remote node. You will need to provide the URL to the selected provider: Geth, Parity or any other Ethereum client. Account: \u00b6 Account: It represents the list of accounts associated with the current environment and their associated balances. On the JsVM, you have a choice of 5 accounts. If you use Injected Web3 with MetaMask, you need to change the account in MetaMask. Gas Limit: \u00b6 This sets the maximum amount of gas that will be allowed for all the transactions created in Remix. Value: \u00b6 This sets the amount of ETH, WEI, GWEI, etc. that are sent to a contract or a payable function. The value is always reset to 0 after each transaction execution. (Note: payable functions have a red button). Initiate Instance \u00b6 In the above image, the select box is set to Ballot. This select box will contain the list of compiled contracts. Deploy sends a transaction that deploys the selected contract. When the transaction is mined, the newly created instance gets added (this might take several seconds). Note: if the constructor has parameters, you need to specify them. At Address is used to access a contract that has already been deployed. It assumes that the given address is an instance of the selected contract. Note: There\u2019s no check at this point, so be cautious when using this feature, and be sure you trust the contract at that address. Pending Instances \u00b6 Validating a transaction might take several seconds. During this time, the GUI shows it in pending mode. When the transaction is mined, the number of pending transactions is updated and the transaction is added to the log (see terminal). Using the ABI \u00b6 Using Deploy or At Address is a classic use case of Remix. However, it is possible to interact with a contract by using its ABI. The ABI is a JSON array that describes its interface. To interact with a contract using the ABI, create a new file in Remix with extension *.abi and copy the ABI content to it. Then, in the input next to At Address, put the Address of the contract you want to interact with. Click on At Address, and a new \u201cconnection\u201d with the contract will popup below. Using the Recorder \u00b6 A Recorder is a tool used to save a bunch of transactions in a JSON file and rerun them later in either the same environment or in another. Saving to the JSON file (called senario.json by default) allows one to easily check the transaction list, tweak input parameters, change linked library, etc. There are many use cases for the Recorder such as After coding and testing contracts in a constrained environment (like the JavaScript VM), you can change the environment and redeploy it to a more realistic environment like a test net with an injected web3 or to a Geth node. The generated senario.json file has the same settings that are used in the Javascript VM. This means that you won\u2019t need to click the interface multiple times to get the state that you achieved originally, making the Recorder a tool that saves you from a lot of hassle. You can also change the settings in the senario.json file to customize the playback. Deploying a contract often requires more than creating one transaction and so the recorder will automate this deployment. Working in a dev environment requires to set up the state in the first place. senario.json \u00b6 To create this file in the recorder, you first need to run some transactions. In the above image, it has a 0 next to Transactions Recorded. This signifies that it isn\u2019t the right moment to save transactions because there aren\u2019t any. The number increase with every transaction you make. Then when you are ready, click the floppy disk icon to create the senario.json file. The JSON file below is an example of the senario.json file. In it, 3 transactions are executed: The first corresponds to the deployment of the lib testLib. The second corresponds to the deployment of the contract test with the first parameter of the constructor set to 11. That contract depends on the library. The linkage is done using the property link references. In that case, we use the address of the previously created library: created{1512830014773}. The number is the ID (timestamp) of the transaction that led to the creation of the library. The third record corresponds to the call to the function set of the contract test (the property is set to created{1512830015080}).

Click the sideways caret to open it up. You will see the functions in the contract. The functions buttons can have different color buttons. Functions that are constant or pure functions in Solidity have blue buttons. Clicking one of these does not create a new transaction. So clicking will not cause state changes but will only return a value stored in the contract without costing you a gas fee. Functions that change the state of the contract AND that do not accept Ether is called non-payable functions and have an orange button. Clicking on them will create a transaction and thus will cost gas. Functions that have red buttons are payable functions in Solidity. Clicking one of these will create a new transaction which can accept a value. The value is put in the Value field which is under the Gas Limit field. For more information see more about the Solidity modifier. If a function requires input parameters you will have to input them. Inputting parameters \u00b6 Inputting parameters in the collapsed view (Inputting all the parameters in a single input box) Parameters are separated by commas. The input box tells you the type of each parameter. Numbers and addresses need not be wrapped in double-quotes. Strings need to be wrapped. In the example above the \u201cdelegate\u201d function has 3 parameters. Inputting parameters in the expanded view \u00b6 Clicking the \u2018down\u2019 caret brings you to the Multi-param Manager, where you can input the parameters one at a time. Much less confusing! In this view, even strings need not be wrapped. Clicking the clipboard icon will encode the inputs and will copy them. Only a valid set of inputs can be encoded. So in case you mistakenly input a unit in place of an address, clicking the clipboard will return you an error. Passing in a tuple or a struct to a function \u00b6 To pass a tuple in, you need to put in an array []. Similarly, to pass in a struct as a parameter of a function, it needs to be put in as an array []. Also, note that the line pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2; needs to put in at the top of the solidity file. Debugger \u00b6 The Debugger module allows you to debug the transaction. You can use it to deploy transactions created from Remix and already mined transactions. Debugging works only if the current environment provides the necessary features. To access the debugger, you can click the \u2018Debug\u2019 button in the terminal when a successful or failed transaction appears there. Alternately, you can load the module from the plugin manager and then click the bug in the icon panel. Or you can run the debug command in the console to go to the debugger. This section gives information about the last compilation. By default, a new analysis is run at each compilation. The analysis tab gives detailed information about the contract code. These details can help you avoid code mistakes and prompt best practices for you. Here is the list of analyzers: \u00b6 Security: \u00b6 Transaction Origin: Warns if tx.origin is used. Check Effects: Avoid potential reentrancy bugs. Inline Assembly: Use of Inline Assembly. Block Timestamp: Semantics may be unclear. Low-level Calls: Semantics may be unclear. Block.blockhash Usage: Semantics may be unclear. Gas & Economy: \u00b6 Gas Costs: Warns if the gas requirements of the functions are too high. This On Local Calls: Invocation of local functions via this. Miscellaneous: \u00b6 Constant Functions: Checks for potentially constant functions. -Similar Variable Names: Checks if variable names are too similar.","title":"Features"},{"location":"xinfinrem/features/#xinfin-remix-develop-smart-contracts-for-the-xinfin-blockchain","text":"XinFin Remix is a web browser-based integrated development environment that allows the user to write Solidity smart contracts, then Compile, Deploy & run the smart contract on XinFin Blockchain Network.","title":"XinFin Remix: Develop Smart Contracts for the XinFin Blockchain"},{"location":"xinfinrem/features/#what-is-xinfin-remix","text":"XinFin Remix is a web browser-based IDE (Integrated development environment) that allows user to write Solidity smart contracts, then Compile, Deploy & run the smart contract on XinFin Blockchain Network","title":"What is XinFin Remix ?"},{"location":"xinfinrem/features/#new-and-upgrade-structure-for-the-xinfin-remix","text":"Icon Panel - click to change which plugin appears in the Side Panel Side Panel - Most but not all plugins will have their GUI here.

The number is the ID (timestamp) of the transaction that led to the creation of the library. The third record corresponds to the call to the function set of the contract test (the property is set to created{1512830015080}).

Click the sideways caret to open it up. You will see the functions in the contract. The functions buttons can have different color buttons. Functions that are constant or pure functions in Solidity have blue buttons. Clicking one of these does not create a new transaction. So clicking will not cause state changes but will only return a value stored in the contract without costing you a gas fee. Functions that change the state of the contract AND that do not accept Ether is called non-payable functions and have an orange button. Clicking on them will create a transaction and thus will cost gas. Functions that have red buttons are payable functions in Solidity. Clicking one of these will create a new transaction which can accept a value. The value is put in the Value field which is under the Gas Limit field.
