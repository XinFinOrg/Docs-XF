# XinFin Network Presents One-Click Installer For Blockchain Node Setup
XinFin invites its existing as well as new global users to set-up masternode using a one-click installer function, and make an impact in the world of decentralized trade and finance.

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is re-defining an inevitable component of our lives, finance. It has always been debated that the world’s financial system is due for a massive upgrade in terms of trust, transparency, accountability, and most importantly decentralization. Bitcoin, the earliest and the most successful chain supports over 8,000 nodes while Ethereum has about 25,000 nodes. Most of the nodes run by these ecosystems are mining nodes that participate in decentralization and distribution of the network.

# Setting up Nodes
Nodes are a necessary component when it comes to becoming a part of the blockchain ecosystem and connecting to the world of decentralized finance, also maintaining the ownership of one’s own data and funds, at the same time.

For Blockchain to reach its full potential, it is necessary to make it simple so that any common person can understand it and can run his own node.This would enable the common men (without much technical knowledge) to control their own data and finances.

Considering that, in; not a very distant future, a household fridge will successfully track the available home food supplies and will make decisions automatically, interacting with the food supply chain, at the same time. It will automatically settle accounts and access external finance using its in-built wallet. It wouldn’t be wrong to say, we are heading towards a future of one blockchain node per household. Seeing the current scenario where every household has a minimum of one computer chip, one blockchain node per household isn’t much of an overwhelming prediction.

Scalability comes with innate simplicity and the purpose of this article is to make things so simple that someone with an average intelligence also finds it easy to set up a node.

At XinFin (eXchange inFinite), our vision is not to reinvent the wheel or compete with any other network (whether legacy, centralized or decentralized), but fine-tune the work already being done in the blockchain industry so that it finds its use in the real world on a day-to-day basis. At the same time, making it interoperable to achieve a use case that runs on the fundamentals of blockchain-something that is still not fully achieved. Yes, you guessed it right!! Decentralized trade and finance.
